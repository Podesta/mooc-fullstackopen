## Simple API Project
Simple project to learn how to use API calls using axios. Fetch country data from restcountries.eu. Countries are filtered without case sensitivity. If more than 10 countries are found, it requests the user to narrow the search down. If 1 up to 10 countries are found, it displays a list of them, with a button on the side that allows the user to display the details from that country. If there is a single match, the details of that country are automatically displayed. There is also an API call to openweathermap to display the weather in the capital of that country.
